  finishingText: "We've found a Giant Panda! This large bear is only found in the remote, mountainous regions of the Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. These animals spend around 12 hours a day just eating! I think I would be ill if I were to eat for that long... As well as the bamboo, these Panda bears also eat bugs, fish and rodents, though bamboo is still the favourite. Let us take a picture of this Panda so we can leave him in peace to eat."

  finishingText: "We've found an African Elephant! Did you know that elephants are some of the largest land animals on the entire planet? The African Elephant uses its long trunk to pick up water, then it sprays the water into its mouth for a drink, or if the Elephant isn't thirsty, it can use it's trunk as a large hose, and will cool itself off with the spray of water. Let us take a picture of her and leave her to catch up with her heard."
